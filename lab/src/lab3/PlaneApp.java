/*
The Colossus Airlines fleet consists of one plane with a seating capacity of 12. It makes one flight
daily. In this experiment, you are required to write a seating reservation application program. The
problem specification is given below:
A. Write a class PlaneSeat that has the following features. Each PlaneSeat object should hold a seat
identification number (seatId), a marker (assigned) that indicates whether the seat is assigned and
the customer number (customerId) of the seat holder. The class diagram is given below:
PlaneSeat
- seatId: int
- assigned: boolean
- customerId: int
+ PlaneSeat(seat_id: int)
+ getSeatID(): int
+ getCustomerID(): int
+ isOccupied(): boolean
+ assign(cust_id: int): void
+ unAssign(): void
where
	PlaneSeat() - is the constructor for the class.
	getSeatID() – a get method that returns the seat number.
	getCustomerID() – a get method that returns the customer number.
	isOccupied() – a method that returns a boolean on whether the seat is occupied.
	assign() – a method that assigns a seat to a customer.
	unAssign() – a method that unassigns a seat.
	
Implement the class PlaneSeat.
B. Write a class Plane that comprises 12 seats. The class should create an array of 12 objects from the
class PlaneSeat.
The class diagram is given below:
Plane
- seat: PlaneSeat[]
- numEmptySeat: int
+ Plane()
- sortSeats() : PlaneSeat[]
+ showNumEmptySeats(): void
+ showEmptySeats(): void
+ showAssignedSeats(bySeatId : boolean): void
+ assignSeat(seatId : int, cust_id : int): void
+ unAssignSeat(seatId : int): void
where
	seat – instance variable containing information on the seats in the plane. It is declared as an
		array of 12 seat objects.
	numEmptySeat – instance variable containing information on the number of empty seats.
	Plane() – a constructor for the class Plane.
	sortSeats() – a method to sort the seats according to ascending order of customerID.
 				A copy of the original seat array is used for sorting instead of the original.
	showNumEmptySeats() – a method to display the number of empty seats.
	showEmptySeats() – a method to display the list of empty seats.
	showAssignedSeat() – a method to display the assigned seats with seat ID and customer ID.
						If bySeatId is true, the order will be by seatID, else order is by
						customerID.
	assignSeat() – a method that assigns a customer ID to an empty seat .
	unAssignSeat() – a method that unassigns a seat.
	
Implement the class Plane.
C. Write an application class PlaneApp that implements the seating reservation program.
The class PlaneApp should be able to support the following:
(1) Show the number of empty seats
(2) Show the list of empty seats
(3) Show the list of customers together with their seat numbers in the order of the seat numbers
(4) Show the list of customers together with their seat numbers in the order of the customer ID
(5) Assign a customer to a seat
(6) Remove a seat assignment
The menu should also contain option (7) (i.e. quit) for terminating the program. After the user
selects a particular option, the corrsponding operation will be executed. If the selected option is
not (7), then the program shows the menu for user selection again. This application does not need
to save data into a file between runs.
Important:
Remember to do all the programming inside the sub-directory lab6 and name the source codes as
PlaneSeat.java, Plane.java and PlaneApp.java and name the compiled codes as PlaneSeat.class,
PlaneSeat.class and PlaneApp.class. 
Test Data:
Test your application program with the following data:
1. Assign a customer to a seat with SeatID=10, CustomerID = 10001.
2. Assign a customer to a seat with SeatID=12, CustomerID = 10002.
3. Assign a customer to a seat with SeatID=8, CustomerID = 10003.
4. Show the the list of customers together with their seat numbers in the order of the seat numbers.
5. Show the number of empty seats.
6. Show the list of empty seats.
7. Assign (attempt) a customer to a seat with any existing CustomerID, and SeatID. (Should give a
warning message!)
8. Remove the seat assignment with SeatID=10.
9. Assign (attempt) a customer to a seat with SeatID = 12.
10. Remove the seat assignment with SeatID=12.
11. Show the list of customers together with their seat numbers in the order of the seat numbers.
12. Show the number of empty seats.
13. Show the list of empty seats.
14. Quit
Expected outputs:
(1) Show number of empty seats
(2) Show the list of empty seats
(3) Show the list of seat assignments by seat ID
(4) Show the list of seat assignments by customer ID
(5) Assign a customer to a seat
(6) Remove a seat assignment
(7) Exit

4 I'm not usually a big fan of Superhero movies but I really enjoyed this one. The acting is good and the characters are pretty believable (within the confines of a fantasy movie). I like most of the  Dwayne Johnson films that I've seen.
4 A fun movie. Not the best movie ever, but full of fun while at the same time having a dark tone. It is worth watching, if only to see The Rock being The Rock.
3 Quite a ride of a movie! The Rock Swings Hard with this one! Keep your brains out and Just enjoy!

3 Decided to give this movie a try, I wasn't expecting much as most malaysian horror flicks tends to disappoint most of time but this movie was actually not bad! Solid storyline, and, even though there are not many ghosts scare but it still radiates the horror ambiance.
2 This movie is probably one of the worst movie in terms of storytelling. Where is the story going and the origin of the story and the ending was confusing for the viewers.

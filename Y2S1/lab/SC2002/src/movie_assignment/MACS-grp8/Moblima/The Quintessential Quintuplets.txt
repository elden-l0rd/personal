5 Despite its odd approach to the romance genre of anime. I can say without a doubt that this is the first anime that I've walked away from smiling and crying at the same time.
5 I LOVE THIS SHOW! This was my first real anime romance comedy, and I was not let down. This show has such amazing character development and relationships that realizing I had reached the last episode sent me into tears. I recommend this to everyone who likes anime. You get invested, even if it take two episodes. It’s a blast of a way to spend your extra time! I can’t wait for the movie.

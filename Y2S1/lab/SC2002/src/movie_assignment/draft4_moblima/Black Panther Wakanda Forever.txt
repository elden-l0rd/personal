5 It's a good Movie, Totally worth Watching and I feel like it would have another sequel. Focusing on Shuri on how she'll Rule and keep Peace With Namor, who will well kinda develop feelings for eachother. And Shuri will have a Hard time to explain on how Nakia and T'Challa has A child. But as I Said this movie is An Important one, So better watch it!
5 I give this movie 1000/10 :) Every scene had me out my chair and it was also funny and quite sad to . Over all this movie deserves its credit <3 Movie of the year !
5 Love it from beginning to end! I love when I don't know how a movie will go and was pleasantly surprised. There's definitely going to be a part 3!
4 Good movie. The storyline was too long as opposed to the action. Angela Basset acted her butt off!!!  I wish there was more Black Panther!! Awesome honor to Chadwick Boseman!!
